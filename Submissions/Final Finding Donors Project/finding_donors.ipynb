    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to perform a transformation on the data and visualize the results. Again, note the range of values and how they are distributed. "

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real World Application: *\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are used in text classification. Two of the real world applications of Naive Bayes classifiers is the spam detection and image classification. Naive bayes classification algorithm is also optimized to enable it to provide a good model for face detection[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths:*\n",
    "Features are considered independent of each other. \n",
    "It is a simplistic but effective classifier and can suit well for the charityML than the algorithms that require more computational power for processing huge data set.\n",
    "Training and prediction speed is effective.\n",
    "All the probabiliies of the data given the hypothesis is already precalculated. So, it just needs to plug in values to calculate the probability of hypothesis given data.\n",
    "Best suited for classification (binary or multi-class classifications).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weakness:*\n",
    "It assumes features to be independent of each other. This is in contrast to the real world scenario.\n",
    "But surprisingly, the classifier seems to work best even in that scenario as more often the influence is not seemed to affect the probabilities severely[4]. \n",
    "The model must be trained as we have new features as the probability of the class given an unseen feature will always be zero unless it is trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reason for Selection:*\n",
    "Training and Prediction speed is very good and uses less computational power. Naive Bayes is preferred when the dimentionality of the data is high [7].  For a charity project, they may not want to spend on expensive high power computational equipments and hence competitive accuracy with Naive Bayes can be the best bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines (SVM):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real World Application: *\n",
    "SVM is used in face detection to identify the parts of the face and determine if it is face or non-face. It has widespread use in bioinformatics in protein classification and cancer classification. SVM helps in Handwriting recognition as well[7]. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths:*\n",
    "It can handle large feature space and can handle non-linear feature interaction.\n",
    "It relies on the boundary points to make decisions and does not rely on the entire data. So, it can handle missing data pretty well. It is not affected much by noise and outliers.\n",
    "There are quite a few parameters to tune to reach the optimum model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weakness:*\n",
    "Poor choice of kernel and regularization hyper-parameters coupled with huge data can severly degrade the performance of SVM. It would be tricky to find appropriate kernel as it may need lot of trial and error. It will take long time when the number of samples grow and will take high computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reason for Selection:*\n",
    "The problem here is the binary classification problem and considering we have quite a number of features, SVM can help to segregate the feature space in a better way and has proven to be effective in most cases. SVM indeed uses lot of computation power and time for training and prediction. This model can be an effective solution if occassional usage of time and resources is not a limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors):**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Real World Application: *\n",
    "KNN is heavily used in text mining and document classification. It is also used in finance industry for stock market forecasting for uncovering trends [9]. KNN has applications in medical industry to determine the risk of patient acquiring the disease based on the demographic and clinical measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Strengths:*\n",
    "Simple but effective algorithm. Primarily used for classification problems but can be used for regression problems as well. The intuition of this algorithm concept makes more sense as the neighbourgood class majority have high probability of determining the class of the new data point around that area. It can work effectively on the large data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weakness:*\n",
    "Computation cost is higher as every data point needs to be checked for its neighbours and the majority vote has to be taken. As the data points grow large, the computation cost increases as well and the time taken for training will increase accordingly. We need to use proper distance metric to compute the closest neighbours. We need to make sure that the K value is reasonably large so that it does not overfit or underfit. This can be found only through multiple iterations of K. Curse of Dimensionality - If the number of dimensions increases, then we need exponential increase in data as the nearest neighbour will be far distant in higher dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reason for Selection:*\n",
    "For charityML, there will be certain features that can influence the income level more than the others. The characteristics of these features can help us classifying the new observation as the observations that are similar tend to closer in distance. Also, the training time for KNN is very low as it is instance based learning. The prediction time will be comparatively higher but it should not be too long considering the dataset is not huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the above, I am going ahead with Gaussian NB, Support Vector Machines and K Nearest Neighbours.\n",

    "Support Vector Machines, or simply SVM, is a supervised machine learning algorithm. By supervised it means that the algorithm can be trained on a set of data points with the associated classification label (i.e., whether the observation belongs to class A or class B ). Later, the model can be used to predict the class of the new observation based on the training performed earlier. On a high level, what this model does is to identify a line on a two dimensional space that can segregate the data points into two different classes. The diagrams provided in the in the below cells illustrate the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the diagram that follows this cell, each data point is plotted in the n-dimensional space ( here we have only 2 dimensions ). The model is fed with these data points to come up with a line that separates both the classes  - green and red points. To arrive at a line that comprehensively separates the two classes, the model uses the data points that are closer to the line and these are called support vectors (marked in the diagram below). The line that separates the two classes will aim to maximize the distance between the support vectors and the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ideal world, there will not be clear noticeable segregation between classes most of the time. There will always be noise and the model has to deal with this. Noise in the observations are the data points that are present in incorrect classes. If we take the same example below in the second diagram, we have one misclassified blue point in red area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are highly robust against outliers (like the one mentioned above). It has option to ignore outliers while it tries to maximize the margin. During training, the SVM algorithm learns from the data points and corrects itself to establish the best margin that can classify both the classes.In real world, as mentioned above the classes are not so easily separable. This model has tuning parameters to tune so that the best model with reasonable accuracy can be achieved. The training of model takes a lot of time and grows significantly with the number of observations and features.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs have proven to be very effective in lot of real world classification problems like face recognition, stock market analysis etc., From the charityML perspective, this would server their puprose of identifying potential donors more accurately so that they have higher chance of getting donation.\n",

    "The important features listed by the RandomForestClassifier is majorly surprising in terms of occupation. The occupation was not even in the list of top 5 features whereas I classified as the top most. This shows the data is very diverse and we have mixed dataset where the occupation do not have any direct influence in predicting the income.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers listed by the classifier includes age, capital-gain and education-num. I listed age as rank 5 whereas it was having the greatest influence in pedicting income according to the model. I selected work-class but as per the model it is not one of the top most influencers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense to think the more number of hours a person works, the more his/her income would be. So, it is quite understandable that hours-per-week is one of the influencers. Having said that this depends on the data set. Because, the labors who are working more hours per week may not match the salaries of executives who are working standard hours per week. One surprise from the above was the relation between the marital status and income. This needs to be examined more carefully as it can either be meaninful or it can be due to mere coincidence in the dataset.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
